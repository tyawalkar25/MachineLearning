End to End Implementation of Machine Learning Problems
This project concerns Loans Data. A predictive model is implemented to determine whether or not to grant the loan based on the likelihood of the loan being repaid. 
The dataset consists of the following fields:
• Loan ID: A unique Identifier for the loan information.
• Customer ID: A unique identifier for the customer. Customers may have more than one loan.
• Loan Status: A categorical variable indicating if the loan was paid back or defaulted.
• Current Loan Amount: This is the loan amount that was either completely paid off, or the amount that was defaulted.
• Term: A categorical variable indicating if it is a short term or long term loan.
• Credit Score: A value between 0 and 800 indicating the riskiness of the borrower’s credit history.
• Years in current job: A categorical variable indicating how many years the customer has been in their current job.
• Home Ownership: Categorical variable indicating home ownership. Values are "Rent", "Home Mortgage", and "Own". If the value is OWN, then the customer is a home owner with no mortgage.
• Annual Income: The customer's annual income
• Purpose: A description of the purpose of the loan.
• Monthly Debt: The customer's monthly payment for their existing loans
• Years of Credit History: The years since the first entry in the customer’s credit history
• Months since last delinquent: Months since the last loan delinquent payment
• Number of Open Accounts: The total number of open credit cards
• Number of Credit Problems: The number of credit problems in the customer records.
• Current Credit Balance: The current total debt for the customer
• Maximum Open Credit: The maximum credit limit for all credit sources.
